On February 14, 2018, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued its press release announcing financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors’ overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company’s expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1. Item 9.01.              Financial Statements and Exhibits. (d) Exhibits The following is furnished as an exhibit to this report and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended: 2SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.  3      EX-99.1 2 exhibit991-q118pressrelease.htm EXHIBIT 99.1              Exhibit     Exhibit 99.1 Agilent Technologies Reports First-Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial ResultsExcellent Start to 2018; Raising Full Year GuidanceHighlights:SANTA CLARA, Calif., February 14, 2018Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenue of $1.21 billion for the first-quarter ended January 31, 2018, up 14 percent year over year (up 10 percent on a core basis(2)).  On a GAAP basis, including the $533 million charge related to U.S. Tax Reform legislation, first-quarter net loss was $320 million, or $0.99 net loss per share. Last year’s first-quarter GAAP net income was $168 million, or $0.52 per share. During the first quarter, Agilent had an adjustment related to U.S. Tax Reform of $533 million, intangible amortization of $25 million, a pension settlement gain of $5 million, transformation costs of $5 million, acquisition and integration costs of $3 million, and $3 million in other costs. Excluding these items and a tax benefit of $28 million, Agilent reported first-quarter non-GAAP net income of $216 million, or $0.66 per share(1).“We are very pleased with our strong start to the year,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent CEO and President. “The Agilent team continued our positive momentum and delivered another excellent quarter of operating results.” “Looking forward, we will keep our focus on driving sustainable above-market growth and delivering value to shareholders through the execution of our proven strategy,” continued McMullen. “Overall, we are well-positioned to continue delivering excellent operating results.”  1First-quarter revenue of $618 million from Agilent’s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) grew 14 percent year over year (up 11 percent on a core basis(2)), with broad strength across all major end markets. LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 25.8 percent.First-quarter revenue of $408 million from Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) grew 12 percent year over year (up 9 percent on a core basis(2)). Growth was strong across services and consumables. ACG’s operating margin for the quarter was 21.6 percent.First-quarter revenue of $185 million from Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) grew 13 percent year over year (up 8 percent on a core basis(2)) led by strong demand for pathology products and companion diagnostics services. DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 11.7 percent.  Agilent expects second-quarter 2018 revenue in the range of $1.20 billion to $1.22 billion. Second-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63 per share(3).For fiscal year 2018, Agilent expects revenue of $4.885 billion to $4.905 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.62 to $2.68 per share(3). The guidance is based on January 31, 2018, currency exchange rates.

Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent’s management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement. # # #(1)Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share primarily exclude the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For Q1 FY18, the impact of Tax Reform is also excluded. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net loss is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.(2)Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q1 FY18 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 7 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth rate as projected for full fiscal year 2018 excludes the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of these exclude amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided for the projection. (3)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 FY18 and full fiscal year 2018 excludes primarily the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, including the impact of Tax Reform. Most of these excluded amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $25 million per quarter. (4)For the three months ended January 31, 2018, our preliminary provision for income taxes is $553 million.  This includes a $533 provision charge for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) enactment. This charge primarily consists of: 1) an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; and 2) an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the 3US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on the Company’s US deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years. The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that the Company may undertake.

For the three months ended January 31, 2018, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.0%.  In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.0%.(b) GAAP diluted net loss per share was computed using 323 million weighted average diluted shares which excludes from consideration the anti-dilutive effects of all potential common shares outstanding.(c) Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was computed using 327 million weighted average diluted shares which includes the dilutive effects of potential common shares outstanding.We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension  settlement gain, NASD site costs, special compliance costs, and adjustment for Tax Reform.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems.Acquisition and Integration costs  include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing. Special compliance costs include costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), revenue recognition and certain tax reporting requirements.Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.Adjustment for Tax Reform primarily consists of an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years.  The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that we may undertake.Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.5AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.SEGMENT INFORMATION(In millions, except where noted)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY Life Sciences and Applied Markets GroupDiagnostics and Genomics Group Agilent CrossLab Group Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to amortization of intangibles, business exit and divestiture costs, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, NASD site costs, and special compliance costs.Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.

(3)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q1 FY18 and full fiscal year 2018 excludes primarily the future impact of acquisition and integration costs, transformation costs, non-cash intangibles amortization, and other related costs.

For the three months and year ended October 31, 2017, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.0% for both periods.  In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.8% and 19.0%, respectively.We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, business exit and divestiture costs, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of investment and loans, pension curtailment gain and pension settlement gain.Asset impairments include assets that have been written-down to their fair value.Business exit and divestiture costs include costs associated with the exit of the NMR business and other business divestitures.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems.Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, tax, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Impairment of investment and loans include an investment and the related convertible loans that have been written down to their fair value.Pension curtailment gain resulted from certain retirement plans benefit reductions.Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.6AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.SEGMENT INFORMATION(In millions, except where noted)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY Life Sciences and Applied Markets GroupDiagnostics and Genomics Group Agilent CrossLab Group Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures.

On August 15, 2017, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued its press release announcing financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2017.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors’ overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.

This information facilitates management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results.

It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company’s expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or is not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 6 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. (2) Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q3 FY17 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 8 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth as projected for full fiscal year 2017 excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of these exclude amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. (3) Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q4 FY17 and full fiscal year 2017 excludes primarily the future impact of acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or is not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Most of these excluded amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $27 million per quarter. (4) Free cash flow as projected for fiscal year 2017 is a non-GAAP measure determined by deducting the projected capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 from the projected operating cash flow for fiscal year 2017.  4NOTE TO EDITORS: Further technology, corporate citizenship and executive news is available on the Agilent news site at www.agilent.com/go/news.5AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS(In millions, except per share amounts)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY  The preliminary income statement is estimated based on our current information.1AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS(In millions, except per share amounts)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY  The preliminary income statement is estimated based on our current information.2AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME(In millions)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY  The preliminary statement of comprehensive income is estimated based on our current information.3AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET(In millions, except par value and share amounts)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY (a) Includes the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-15.The preliminary balance sheet is estimated based on our current information.4AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS(In millions)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY  The preliminary cash flow is estimated based on our current information.5AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND DILUTED EPS RECONCILIATIONS(In millions, except per share amounts)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY (a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to on-going operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2017, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of  16.2% and 18.0%, respectively.  In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.0%.We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, business exit and divestiture costs, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension curtailment gain and pension settlement gain.Asset impairments include assets that have been written-down to their fair value.Business exit and divestiture costs include costs associated with the exit of the NMR business and other business divestitures.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems.Acquisition and Integration costs  include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Pension curtailment gain resulted from certain retirement plans benefit reductions.Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees.

This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.

On February 14, 2018, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued its press release announcing financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors’ overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company’s expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1. Item 9.01.              Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(NYSE: A) today reported revenue of $1.21 billion for the first-quarter ended January 31, 2018, up 14 percent year over year (up 10 percent on a core basis(2)).  On a GAAP basis, including the $533 million charge related to U.S. Tax Reform legislation, first-quarter net loss was $320 million, or $0.99 net loss per share. Last year’s first-quarter GAAP net income was $168 million, or $0.52 per share. During the first quarter, Agilent had an adjustment related to U.S. Tax Reform of $533 million, intangible amortization of $25 million, a pension settlement gain of $5 million, transformation costs of $5 million, acquisition and integration costs of $3 million, and $3 million in other costs. Excluding these items and a tax benefit of $28 million, Agilent reported first-quarter non-GAAP net income of $216 million, or $0.66 per share(1).“We are very pleased with our strong start to the year,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent CEO and President. “The Agilent team continued our positive momentum and delivered another excellent quarter of operating results.” “Looking forward, we will keep our focus on driving sustainable above-market growth and delivering value to shareholders through the execution of our proven strategy,” continued McMullen. “Overall, we are well-positioned to continue delivering excellent operating results.”  1First-quarter revenue of $618 million from Agilent’s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) grew 14 percent year over year (up 11 percent on a core basis(2)), with broad strength across all major end markets. LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 25.8 percent.First-quarter revenue of $408 million from Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) grew 12 percent year over year (up 9 percent on a core basis(2)). Growth was strong across services and consumables. ACG’s operating margin for the quarter was 21.6 percent.First-quarter revenue of $185 million from Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) grew 13 percent year over year (up 8 percent on a core basis(2)) led by strong demand for pathology products and companion diagnostics services. DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 11.7 percent.  Agilent expects second-quarter 2018 revenue in the range of $1.20 billion to $1.22 billion. Second-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63 per share(3).For fiscal year 2018, Agilent expects revenue of $4.885 billion to $4.905 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.62 to $2.68 per share(3).

Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent’s management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement. # # #(1)Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share primarily exclude the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For Q1 FY18, the impact of Tax Reform is also excluded. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net loss is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.(2)Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q1 FY18 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 7 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth rate as projected for full fiscal year 2018 excludes the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of these exclude amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided for the projection. (3)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 FY18 and full fiscal year 2018 excludes primarily the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, including the impact of Tax Reform. Most of these excluded amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $25 million per quarter. (4)For the three months ended January 31, 2018, our preliminary provision for income taxes is $553 million.  This includes a $533 provision charge for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) enactment. This charge primarily consists of: 1) an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; and 2) an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the 3US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on the Company’s US deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years. The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that the Company may undertake.

For the three months ended January 31, 2018, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.0%.  In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.0%.(b) GAAP diluted net loss per share was computed using 323 million weighted average diluted shares which excludes from consideration the anti-dilutive effects of all potential common shares outstanding.(c) Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was computed using 327 million weighted average diluted shares which includes the dilutive effects of potential common shares outstanding.We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension  settlement gain, NASD site costs, special compliance costs, and adjustment for Tax Reform.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems.Acquisition and Integration costs  include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing. Special compliance costs include costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), revenue recognition and certain tax reporting requirements.Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.Adjustment for Tax Reform primarily consists of an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years.  The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that we may undertake.Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.5AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.SEGMENT INFORMATION(In millions, except where noted)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY Life Sciences and Applied Markets GroupDiagnostics and Genomics Group Agilent CrossLab Group Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to amortization of intangibles, business exit and divestiture costs, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, NASD site costs, and special compliance costs.Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.The preliminary segment information is estimated based on our current information.6AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.RECONCILIATION OF REVENUE BY SEGMENT EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS (CORE)(In millions)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY  .(a)  We compare the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency rate fluctuations to assess the performance of our underlying business.  To determine the impact of currency fluctuations, current and prior year period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the actual exchange rate in effect during the last month of the current period.The preliminary reconciliation of GAAP revenue adjusted for recent acquisitions and divestitures and impact of currency is estimated based on our current information.7      ",2018-02-14 16:27:02,"['Item 2.02', 'Item 2.02', 'Item 9.01']",6.9700000000000015,19.26,1.95,-5.76,-3.62,35.35000000000001

It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company’s expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

We also exclude any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or is not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 6 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. (2)Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q4 FY17 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 8 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. (3)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q1 FY18 and full fiscal year 2018 excludes primarily the future impact of acquisition and integration costs, transformation costs, non-cash intangibles amortization, and other related costs. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or is not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability.

For the three months and year ended October 31, 2017, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.0% for both periods.  In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.8% and 19.0%, respectively.We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, business exit and divestiture costs, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of investment and loans, pension curtailment gain and pension settlement gain.Asset impairments include assets that have been written-down to their fair value.Business exit and divestiture costs include costs associated with the exit of the NMR business and other business divestitures.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems.Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, tax, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Impairment of investment and loans include an investment and the related convertible loans that have been written down to their fair value.Pension curtailment gain resulted from certain retirement plans benefit reductions.Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.6AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.SEGMENT INFORMATION(In millions, except where noted)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY Life Sciences and Applied Markets GroupDiagnostics and Genomics Group Agilent CrossLab Group Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures.

We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or is not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 6 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. (2) Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q3 FY17 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 8 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth as projected for full fiscal year 2017 excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of these exclude amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided.

For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2017, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of  16.2% and 18.0%, respectively.  In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.0%.We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, business exit and divestiture costs, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension curtailment gain and pension settlement gain.Asset impairments include assets that have been written-down to their fair value.Business exit and divestiture costs include costs associated with the exit of the NMR business and other business divestitures.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems.Acquisition and Integration costs  include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Pension curtailment gain resulted from certain retirement plans benefit reductions.Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.6AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.SEGMENT INFORMATION(In millions, except where noted)(Unaudited)PRELIMINARY Life Sciences and Applied Markets GroupDiagnostics and Genomics Group Agilent CrossLab Group Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures.
